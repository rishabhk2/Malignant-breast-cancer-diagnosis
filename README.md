# Malignant-breast-cancer-diagnosis

In this project, I applied some popular machine learning techniques to the problem of classifying data from histological cell images for the diagnosis of malignant breast cancer. This will be presented as a practical scenario where you are approached by a client to solve a problem.
The main aims of this assignment are:
to use the best practice machine learning workflow for producing a solution to a client's problem;
to visualise data and determine the best pre-processing;
to create the necessary datasets for training and testing purposes;
to train and optimise a selection of models, then choose the best;
to obtain an unbiased measurement of the final model's performance;
to interpret results clearly and concisely.
This assignment relates to the following ACS CBOK areas: abstraction, design, hardware and software, data and information, HCI and programming.
