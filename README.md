# Malignant-breast-cancer-diagnosis

In this project, I applied some popular machine learning techniques to the problem of classifying data from histological cell images for the diagnosis of malignant breast cancer. This will be presented as a practical scenario where you are approached by a client to solve a problem.
The main aims of this assignment are:
to use the best practice machine learning workflow for producing a solution to a client's problem;
to visualise data and determine the best pre-processing;
to create the necessary datasets for training and testing purposes;
to train and optimise a selection of models, then choose the best;
to obtain an unbiased measurement of the final model's performance;
to interpret results clearly and concisely.

Clients requirements are:
1) have at least a 95% probability of detecting malignant cancer when it is present
2) have no more than 1 in 10 healthy cases (those with benign tumours) labelled as positive (malignant).

This assignment relates to the following ACS CBOK areas: abstraction, design, hardware and software, data and information, HCI and programming.
